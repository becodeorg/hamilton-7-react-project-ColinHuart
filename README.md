# Pomodoro timer

For this project, realised with the Becode course, we could chose between differents projects, with the only common point that it should have done with React.
The main components that we had to do was : 
- a Timer
- start and stop buttons
- buttons to add and remove times
- a modal that display at the end of the time

I also add somes extras such as a progress bar.
